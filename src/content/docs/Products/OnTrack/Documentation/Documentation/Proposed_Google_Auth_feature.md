` `**Google Authentication Implementation in Ruby on Rails Introduction** 

This report details the attempted implementation of Google authentication using the google-api-client gem, challenges encountered, and a proposal for a new approach using the google-authenticator library available here the goal is to establish a secure, robust, and efficient authentication system within a Ruby on Rails application.![](Aspose.Words.c43d72fd-87a7-4c94-8fb6-36b8e9a45b16.001.png)

**What Was Tried and Why It Didn't Work** 

**Previous Implementation Steps** 

1. **Setup Using google-api-client:** 
- Integrated the gem to handle Google OAuth 2.0.
- Created an endpoint in authentication\_api.rb for Google authentication (/auth/google). 
- Configured token verification using Google::Apis::Oauth2V2::Oauth2Service. 
- Generated temporary tokens for authenticated users.
2. **Challenges Identified:** 
- **Token Validation Failures:** Issues with API key configuration and scope validation caused intermittent failures.
- **Complexity in Library Usage:** The google-api-client gem required extensive configuration and debugging for basic functionality.
- **Session Management:** Temporary tokens generated lacked proper integration with the application's session flow.![](Aspose.Words.c43d72fd-87a7-4c94-8fb6-36b8e9a45b16.002.png)

**Proposed Approach: Using google-authenticator** 

The[ Google-authenticator ](https://github.com/jaredonline/google-authenticator)  library offers a simplified and efficient way to implement Google OAuth 2.0. It abstracts much of the complexity of token validation and user data retrieval. 

**Key Benefits:** 

- Simplified integration of Google authentication.
- Minimal configuration with a focus on token validation and secure user onboarding. 
- Lightweight and developer-friendly, reducing overhead. ![](Aspose.Words.c43d72fd-87a7-4c94-8fb6-36b8e9a45b16.003.png)

**Implementation Plan Using google-authenticator** 

1. **Gem Installation** 

Add the google-authenticator gem to the Gemfile: 

**gem 'google-authenticator'** 

Run bundle install to install the gem. 

2. **Environment Setup** 

Set up environment variables for secure management of credentials: **export GOOGLE\_CLIENT\_ID="your-client -id"** 

**export GOOGLE\_CLIENT\_SECRET="your-client -secret"** 

3. **Refactor authentication\_api.rb** 

Update the authentication\_api.rb file to use the new library: 

**desc 'Google authentication'**

**params do** 

`  `**requires :id\_token, type: String, desc: 'Google ID token' end** 

**post '/auth/google' do** 

**# Initialize the GoogleAuthenticator** 

`  `**authenticator = GoogleAuthenticator.new(**

`    `**client\_id: ENV['GOOGLE\_CLIENT\_ID'],** 

`    `**client\_secret: ENV['GOOGLE\_CLIENT\_SECRET']** 

`  `**)** 

`  `**idinfo = authenticator.verify(params[:id\_token])** 

`  `**error!({ error: 'Invalid Google ID token.' }, 401) unless idinfo** 

`  `**email = idinfo['email']** 

`  `**logger.info "Authenticate #{email} from #{request.ip}"** 

`  `**user = User.find\_or\_create\_by(email: email) do |new\_user|     new\_user.first\_name = idinfo['given\_name'] || 'First'** 

`    `**new\_user.last\_name = idinfo['family\_name'] || 'Last'** 

`    `**new\_user.username = email.split('@').first**

`    `**new\_user.role\_id = Role.student.id** 

`  `**end**

`  `**onetime\_token = user.generate\_temporary\_authentication\_token!**

`  `**present :user, user, with: Entities::UserEntity** 

`  `**present :auth\_token, onetime\_token.authentication\_token**

**end** 

4. **Testing** 

Conduct functional and security testing for the updated implementation:

- Validate token-based authentication using Google accounts.
- Test various scenarios such as invalid tokens and token expiration.
- Simulate edge cases like incorrect client credentials.
5. **Deployment and Documentation**
- Deploy the changes to a staging environment for compatibility testing.
- Update API documentation to reflect the new authentication endpoint.

**Next Steps and Recommendations**

**Short-Term Actions:** 

- Finalize the integration with google-authenticator. 
- Conduct comprehensive testing, focusing on security and performance.
- Roll out the updated authentication mechanism during non-peak hours. 

**Long-Term Improvements:** 

- Implement refresh token functionality for long-lived sessions. 
- Expand support for additional authentication providers, ensuring scalability.

**Conclusion** 

The switch to the google-authenticator library addresses the shortcomings of the previous approach while simplifying the integration process. This plan provides a clear path toward a reliable and secure Google authentication mechanism in the application. By leveraging this lightweight library, we can reduce complexity and improve user experience.
