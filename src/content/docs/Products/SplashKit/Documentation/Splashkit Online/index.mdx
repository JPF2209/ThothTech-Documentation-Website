## The SplashKit Online Team

The SplashKit Online Team manages all aspects of the
[SplashKit Online IDE](https://thoth-tech.github.io/splashkit-online/) website, a web-based IDE
designed to help beginner programmers quickly start building 2D games directly in the browser.

It currently supports JavaScript (with experimental C++ functionality) and leverages WebAssembly
(Wasm) to execute SplashKit code, but the goal is to expand this support to include all languages
that SplashKit supports: C++, C#, Python, and Pascal.

The team’s responsibilities include:

- Ensuring consistent styling and branding across the site
- Improving language support by integrating additional language support. (Currently supporting
  Javascript and (experimental) C++.)
- Optimising the site’s usability and accessibility for a smooth user experience by improving the
  user experience, performance and language-specific features.
